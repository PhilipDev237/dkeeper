App description:

DKeeper is an ICP decentralised application that enables users to keep notes online.
The user can create as many notes as they desire and come back to them at any time.
The data is persisted in Canisters using Motoko language. Frontend code is written in Javascript
with React library.

## USAGE:

# Local PC

- Go to the master branch to get the source code
- Download the ZIP file and extract 
- For Windows users, copy the extracted file to the Ubuntu location of your projects
- Open VSCode and proceed

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd dkeeper/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
